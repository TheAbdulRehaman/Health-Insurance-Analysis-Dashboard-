# Health-Insurance-Analysis-Dashboard-
Designed a Power BI dashboard to analyse factors influencing health insurance premium charges and customer segmentation
🔍 Objective

The goal of this project was to design and develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyses the key factors influencing health insurance premium charges. The dashboard enables insurers, analysts, and stakeholders to explore customer segmentation, risk indicators, and premium variability using data-driven insights.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI Desktop

Power Query (ETL)

DAX (Measures & Calculations)

Data Modelling (Star Schema design)

Data Visualisation & UX Design

🔄 Process & Approach

1. Data Import & Cleaning

Loaded raw health insurance data into Power BI.

Performed transformations (handling missing values, normalisation, renaming fields).

Ensured proper data types and built a clean, analysis-ready dataset.

2. Exploratory Analysis

Investigated distributions of BMI, age, children (dependents), charges, and smoking status.

Identified patterns in premium variability across demographic segments.

3. Data Modelling & DAX

Developed calculated columns and measures for premium comparisons, risk scoring, and segmentation.

Created relationships and optimised the model for performance and analytical depth.

4. Dashboard Development

Built interactive visuals to analyse:

Premium charges by age group, BMI category, and number of dependents.

Smoking vs non-smoking premium differences.

Regional comparisons and demographic clustering (where applicable).

Applied correlation analysis to identify strong predictors of premium changes.

5. Insights Integration

Added tooltips, slicers, dynamic measures, and drill-through views for deeper exploration.

Designed the dashboard with a clean, user-centric layout for clarity and usability.

📈 Key Insights & Impact

Identified smoking status and BMI as the most influential factors increasing premium charges.

Revealed how age and dependents moderately influence costs, supporting targeted pricing strategies.

Delivered clear segmentation views allowing insurers to optimise risk assessment, improve premium transparency, and personalise policy recommendations.

Enhanced decision-making by providing an end-to-end analytical framework for health insurance pricing analysis.
